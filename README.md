# odin-recipes

This is a project to develop my basic HTML skills by creating a simple 
website showing various recipes.

During this project I learned how to wrap text in tags after inserting it and automatically wrap text in VScode.

I also practiced creating various links, creating lists, formatting text, making regular commits with helpful messages and creating the basic HTML header.
